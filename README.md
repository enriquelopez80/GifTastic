** Overview **

This page utilizes the GIPHY API to display sports GIFs. The user is presented some buttons at the top of the page and when clicked, 10 sports GIFs are deployed with their ratings. The user can click on the GIFs to animate and click again to stop the animation.

The user also has the choice to add their own sport as a button to the list. Once that button is added, the user can click on the new button to display those 10 GIFs.
